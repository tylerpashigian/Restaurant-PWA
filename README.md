# The Tab
Welcome to The Tab! The idea for this application was inspired by QR code restaurant menus during the Covid-19 Pandemic. There will be 2 main use cases - restaurant menu data management tool for restaurants, and a customer facing app that allows diners to order from the menu, add items to a live cart, and checking out, all from the app. The menu will be able to be accessed via a QR code at the table, which takes users to a menu, and adds all items to a unique cart specific to that table. The app will allow users to split the tab in 3 ways: one person, split evenly based user count in the cart, or itemized. This application was intended to be added to the home screen of mobile devices as a PWA, but will work in any browser.
